          <h1>Capture and Share the World's Moments</h1>

          <p> Instagram is a <span> fast, beautiful </span>and <span> fun </span>way to share your life with friends and
            family.

            Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look and feel, then post to Instagram &mdash; it's
            that easy. You can even share to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a new way to see the world.

            Oh yeah, did we mention it's free?</p>
